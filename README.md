## Synopsis

Arsenic contamination of drinking water is a global issue affecting in the region of 150 million people. Currently, drinking water is predominantly tested via chemical sensors, which require toxic reagents, technical expertise and only produces qualitative results.  Developments in synthetic biology have shown that biological components can be engineered for heavy metal detection, but methods are limited by GM contamination risks and only provide qualitative readouts.  As such, an opportunity has been identified to develop a first-of -kind cell-free quantitative heavy metal sensor which uses the synthesis of an electroactive metabolic enzyme for amperometric quantification of arsenic concentrations. 

The system proposed will use a genetic circuit consisting of a promoter responsive to arsenic and a downstream reporter which produces an electroactive enzyme. The enzyme concentration will then be measured using amperometric detection methods allowing a quantitative measurement of arsenic concentration to be determined.


## Biological System

Explain functionality of software components (if any) as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Ideally, this should be pseudo code or an abstract graphical representation of your code e.g entity relationship diagram. Consider adding a screenshot of your User Interface.

## Electrochemistry

Explain how the hardware components (if any) of your project function as concisely as possible, including a short description of fabrication and assembly. Component suppliers and part numbers should be provided separately in a bill of materials, in a 'Hardware Folder'.

## Hardware

Provide instructions on usage, describe a test scheme and show how to run the tests with code and hardware configuration examples with some representative results.
